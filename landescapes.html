            <p class="proseTitle">Foreword</p>
            <p>
              My gift to you: portraits of irreality. These are the places that
              do not exist until perception wills them into private universes of
              memory and dream. Each time they are read they are transformed;
              but they grow, texture, and warp into places where I cannot
              follow, for they are yours now, and yours alone. Where do these
              words take you? Where do you rejoice? Where do you mourn? Where
              are the landscapes I have planted, but can never inhabit? Carried
              in those who read. All that I will ever be or do, carried in those
              who read.
            </p>

            <p class="proseTitle">1. Observatory</p>
            <p>
              Between low palms rooted in chalky gravel laps a poolside after
              twilight. Garden lamps chaperone the stars from a lion’s golden
              fountain mouth, into a ceiling where the firmament watches back.
              Time is liquid shimmer and shadow, a hologram on naked concrete.
            </p>

            <p class="proseTitle">2. Conch</p>
            <p>
              The ocean whispers through a calcium carbonate atrium. Iridescent
              furniture, weathered and minuscule, collect beneath a window into
              the meridian. Looking outward; glittering, waveless, deep as sky,
              ribboned with pastel light.
            </p>

            <p class="proseTitle">3. Silk</p>
            <p>
              One moss-draped stone stands in a silky sea of grass. Under water
              or under sky? Caressing wind or serene undertow? Remnants of a
              carved face, eroded to sunken slate suggestion, leaving an
              eternity behind.
            </p>

            <p class="proseTitle">4. Teacup</p>
            <p>
              Under oolong heavens steams a wilderness of violet leaf. Where, in
              the convection of warm thermals rising, is written word? Air is
              uncertainty, flecked and granular. A golden screen trembles. There
              is only now.
            </p>

            <p class="proseTitle">5. City</p>
            <p>
              A night drive through monument fields; pillars exhaling light.
              Rainbows of rain-dew twist on the windshield before tucking into
              overpass vines and monochromatic tunnels, sodium-glaring, loud,
              and vicious.
            </p>

            <p class="proseTitle">6. Weeping Coast</p>
            <p>
              Coastal pines weep in the mist, beading brine. The fog is hazy
              blue, fraught with the groans of an unseen shore. A foghorn is
              drowned, a lighthouse spills its warning, and trees ache to know
              the driftwood souls battering their cliffs.
            </p>

            <p class="proseTitle">7. Vineyard</p>
            <p>
              There is a place roofed in baked clay gable, where sun kisses
              every trellis and the dirt hill-trails are ever ripe with spice.
              White stucco runs rough against fingertips and for labor’s every
              scrape there is a cloud drifting overhead, turning over in its
              slumber.
            </p>

            <p class="proseTitle">8. Primordial</p>
            <p>
              The unconscious stirring of storms, waking sediment. A diurnal
              moon with no face ripens low in the belly of the horizon, pulling
              acidic tides into dreams of ferns. History: a micelle that didn’t
              burst.
            </p>

            <p class="proseTitle">9. Ivy</p>
            <p>
              Ivy scaling brick: stark in the daylight, ramose and invading. At
              night, a comforting shadow, a blanket of rustling sophistication.
            </p>

            <p class="proseTitle">10. Mojave Dream</p>
            <p>
              The desert yawns, donning evening pastels. Cacti of every hue
              reach with skyward arms, releasing the day’s last dry heat like a
              phantom laid to rest. Cool silence trembles at a rustle. The dry
              lake comes back to life.
            </p>

            <p class="proseTitle">11. Derelict</p>
            <p>
              Still water, like murky green resin. Suspended within is a ghost —
              a white vessel of colossal proportion and luxury, lurking beyond a
              mirror’s opposing realm. Motionless arms of algae possess it to
              the depths.
            </p>

            <p class="proseTitle">12. Red World</p>
            <p>
              Belonging to another star is a world of red grass and monument
              mountains, sanguine and heady, walked by no locomotive life. The
              trees bleed in delight, never wicked, forever celebrating the brim
              of providence and probability. An alien breeze bows the forests,
              untouched by fire, ignorant of a heat separate from its own.
            </p>

            <p class="proseTitle">13. Monsoon</p>
            <p>
              Through slatted blinds rains an unconscious longing. It coils
              around the water-heavy aroids in globular planters, taller than
              people, circumnavigating the building on an agitated gray morning.
              Jungles tuck away concrete. Construction scaffolding rises through
              the canopy, creaking in the storm’s intermittent showers. Is there
              a better way to reconcile?
            </p>

            <p class="proseTitle">14. The Edge</p>
            <p>
              The knife-edge of existence is a winter of ash upon a sleeping
              world. Trees, an ethereal field of withered shadows. Illusory
              peace; the memory of voices, hushed in unison. Look not for green
              sprouts. A fissured sun swallows every flickering thought.
            </p>

            <p class="proseTitle">15. Limestone</p>
            <p>
              Limestone wall, greatest barrier, housing ceramic tile and
              cerulean water. Brighter than bone, salted and fossilized home.
            </p>

            <p class="proseTitle">16. Barley</p>
            <p>
              Endless gold. Wade through it, wear it; the caressing stalks, the
              corona of sunset, an undying promise.
            </p>

            <p class="proseTitle">17. Industry</p>
            <p>
              This, too, an organism. Arterial roads, eating and exhaling.
              Microorganisms in its gray gut, millions in legion, systems of a
              body. A metal fan squeals, whisking daylight. Steam rises from a
              coffee-warmed morning. Utility poles follow the motions of worn
              jackets, standing above the autumn pruned trees.
            </p>

            <p class="proseTitle">18. Kitchen</p>
            <p>
              Sunset in a glass kitchen: blocked and slatted walls, opened to
              gold-dipped hedges. A table, large and wonderful, fashioned from
              strong rich wood and crammed into the midst of appliances still
              smudged from use. Many places are set and the sun feasts until
              sleep, well-fed.
            </p>

            <p class="proseTitle">19. Aquarium</p>
            <p>
              Habitat of mixed foreigners; too-green plants, polished rocks, and
              tropical fish from water bodies that have never merged. They share
              a bed of oxygen. Orbs of light defy the daily cycle and the
              filtering motor hum is the anthem of displacement.
            </p>

            <p class="proseTitle">20. Diatom</p>
            <p>
              A quiet emerald community, thick as agar, thin as a datum. A
              single slide, illuminated. A kaleidoscope of cellular efficiency,
              proud of noble geometry. To the observing eye, a treasure of
              jewels.
            </p>

            <p class="proseTitle">21. Mountaintop</p>
            <p>
              At the peak coalesces solemnity and silence. Pearly snow pools in
              abundance, never touched. Nothing grows, nothing stirs. The peace
              of ascendency is solitude. Thin air, feeble wind, distant land
              unrolled like a stained dining room carpet. Gray skies follow,
              like a knowing shadow, over the long road home.
            </p>

            <p class="proseTitle">22. Cherry Blossoms</p>
            <p>
              The trees are blushing pink and the white painted asphalt
              stretches crisp and loud through a morning fog. Traffic treads and
              is spilled upon; a dichotomy of powder and oil, sweet perfume and
              petroleum bitters.
            </p>

            <p class="proseTitle">23. Museum</p>
            <p>
              Marble is a story, veined like a hand. Echoes drift through arched
              halls and sublimate into statues upon capture. Viewership alters
              the form. All art shies under gaze, retreating into falsehood,
              riddling truth.
