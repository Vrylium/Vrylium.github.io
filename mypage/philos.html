    Don't cultivate regrets. What decisions can I make now, so that I'll
    <b>be proud of myself</b> in the future?

    <b>Stay soft</b> and don't be afraid to wear my heart on my sleeve. Don't
    become hard and callous, no matter how bad life gets.

    Nihilism must not inspire apathy. When the universe doesn't care, the most
    human and meaningful thing we can do in the face of emptiness is to
    <b>care very, very much.</b>

    There can be no intimacy in the absence of love. Love is an essential
    component of <b>human connection</b> on every level. Give love freely and
    often, in whatever form the situation warrants.

    <b>Devotion</b> is key. Hard work, patience, and dedication are a recipe for

    Never stop learning. Always <b>stay curious</b>, and always be on the hunt
    for new information, skills, and things worth getting excited about.

    Be flexible where it counts. Don't hesitate to revise opinions when
    presented with verifiable counter-evidence.
    <b>Adapt fluidly and find new solutions</b> from moment to moment whenever
    something goes awry.
