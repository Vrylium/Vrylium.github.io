<h3>✦ Philosophies</h3>
<p><ul>
  <li>
    Don't cultivate regrets. What decisions can I make now, so that I'll be
    proud of myself in the future?
  </li>
  <li>
    Stay soft and don't be afraid to wear my heart on my sleeve. Don't become
    hard and callous, no matter how bad life gets.
  </li>
  <li>
    Nihilism must not inspire apathy. When the universe doesn't care, the most
    human and meaningful thing we can do in the face of emptiness is to care
    very, very much.
  </li>
  <li>
    There can be no intimacy in the absence of love. Love is an essential
    component of human connection on every level. Give love freely and often, in
    whatever form the situation warrants.
  </li>
  <li>
    Devotion is key. Hard work, patience, and dedication are a recipe for
    greatest success when applied to something that really matters.
  </li>
  <li>
    Never stop learning. Always stay curious, and always be on the hunt for new
    information, skills, and things worth getting excited about.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be flexible where it counts. Don't hesitate to revise opinions when
    presented with verifiable counter-evidence. Adapt fluidly and find new
    solutions from moment to moment whenever something goes awry.
  </li>
