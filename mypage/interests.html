<h3>✦ Writing</h3>
<p>
  My primary hobby revolves around writing fiction and poetry. Everything I
  write is incredibly personal and contains my entire heart, without exception.
  I've met some truly amazing people through writing, which has been its
  greatest reward. The soul of writing is connecting people on an intimate and
  personal level, therefore I believe it to be the most significant and
  worthwhile craft I engage in.

<h3>✦ Video Games</h3>
<p>
  I've been escaping the world through video games since I was old enough hold a
  controller. The element of participation in a narrative has captured my
  imagination, challenged my ability, and developed my problem-solving skills in
  ways other entertainment could never imitate. I enjoy difficult games with
  strong stories and detailed worlds. My favorite games and IPs are: Mass
  Effect, Fallout, "Soulsbornes", Metroid, Animal Crossing, Pokemon, and No
  Man's Sky.

<h3>✦ Coding</h3>
<p>
  Ever since I was a kid I've enjoyed modifying the simple HTML of my profile
  pages, but it wasn't until very recently that I got serious about learning
  more front end web design. Lately, I've been obsessed with refining my skills
  with HTML and CSS on the way to taking JavaScript lessons. I feel at home in
  front of technology and I'm eager to learn more.

<h3>✦ Horror</h3>
<p>
  I believe in confronting one's greatest fears and gaining a deep understanding
  of them. I explore my terror of alienation and powerlessness through
  sidestream horror genres known as "analog", "gothic", and "cosmic" horror.
  Each depict nightmares of irreality. I consider myself a horror writer first
  and foremost by creating works that scare me to death, but also introduce a
  sense of hope that rewards journeys through horrific circumstances. Overcoming
  fear, doubt, and pain is how we grow as people.

<h3>✦ World History</h3>
<p>
  My fascination with world history began at a very early age when I'd watch
  historical documentaries with my father. I think it's so important to
  understand where we came from as a species; to understand our nature, our
  triumphs, and our atrocities, so that we can be more informed members of
  society. Never look away and never forget. We need to know these things to see
  where we are going, because people are still the same animals we always were.

<h3>✦ Mechanical Keyboards</h3>
<p>
  As a writer, I spend a lot of time around keyboards. It makes a huge
  difference when the input mechanism is pleasing to use, so I've invested in
  three mechanical keyboards (RK61, RK71, and Keychron K2), along with several
  keycap sets. I've lubed the switches of my hot-swappable RK71 and have plans
  to buy new switches in the future to experiment with.

<h3>✦ Journaling</h3>
<p>
  I started journaling again in January 2022. All my life I've journaled in
  temporary spells that usually end in the destruction of the journal. In
  December 2021 I had an epiphany about the fragility of memory and experience,
  especially pronounced in myself (I deal with derealization). I'm currently
  using Log+Jotter 3.5" x 5.5" journals; the size makes writing consistently
  less daunting when you only have to fill one small page per entry. I like to
  accompany my entries with stickers, either obtained that day or depicting
  subject matter related to that day. I also bought a date stamp, a Bellroy
  leather journal cover, and a rOtring 600 refillable pen. Good accessories make
  journaling more exciting. I only wish I had started sooner.

<h3>✦ Solarpunk</h3>
<p>
  This optimistic, sustainable ideal for the future of civilization is extremely
  relevant in the face of impending climate disaster. Solarpunk champions
  renewable energy, socialism, and symbiosis with nature. The soul of Solarpunk
  is rebellious despite its peaceful packaging. It will require a massive
  overhaul of society as we know it to achieve Solarpunk ideals, and change
  never comes easily.
