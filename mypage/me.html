            I'm Katherine and this is my self-portrait; the canvas of my
            personality, hopes, and ideas. It's not an archive of the past. It's a representation of my present self, whoever that may be. I update according to no predictable schedule,
            only the schedule that emerges from the rhythm of my life events.
          </p>
          <p>
            I studied biochemistry in college and became the manager of a food
            safety quality assurance department and its laboratory in 2021.
            While my career is focused within the biological and chemical
            sciences, I'm equally passionate about literature and art.
          </p>
          <p>
            Generally, I'm quiet and reserved, preferring peaceful and relaxed
            environments whether found indoors or in nature. In comfortable
            company, I open up a lot. I don't even self-describe as shy anymore.
            I like asking people questions and hearing their stories. I'm
            enthusiastic about pretty much everything that isn't
            sports-related. If you know where and how to look, the world always
            has something interesting to offer.

      <div class="carousel__item">
        <h2>INTERESTS</h2>
        <div class="inside">
          <h3>✦ Writing</h3><p>My primary hobby revolves around writing fiction and poetry. Everything I write is incredibly personal and contains my entire heart, without exception. I've met some truly amazing people through writing, which has been its greatest reward. The soul of writing is connecting people on an intimate and personal level, therefore I believe it to be the most significant and worthwhile craft I engage in.</p>
      <br>
          <h3>✦ Video Games</h3><p>I've been escaping the world through video games since I was old enough hold a controller. The element of participation in a narrative has captured my imagination, challenged my ability, and developed my problem-solving skills in ways other entertainment could never imitate. I enjoy difficult games with strong stories and detailed worlds. My favorite games and IPs are: Mass Effect, Fallout, "Soulsbornes", Metroid, Animal Crossing, Pokemon, and No Man's Sky.</p>
       <br>
          <h3>✦ Coding</h3><p>Ever since I was a kid I've enjoyed modifying the simple HTML of my profile pages, but it wasn't until very recently that I got serious about learning more front end web design. Lately, I've been obsessed with refining my skills with HTML and CSS on the way to taking JavaScript lessons. I feel at home in front of technology and I'm eager to learn more.</p>   
        <br> 
          <h3>✦ Horror</h3><p>I believe in confronting one's greatest fears and gaining a deep understanding of them. I explore my terror of alienation and powerlessness through various sidestream horror genres known as "analog", "gothic", and "cosmic" horror. Each depict nightmares of irreality. I consider myself a horror writer first and foremost by creating works that scare me to death, but also introduce a sense of hope that rewards journeys through horrific circumstances. Overcoming fear, doubt, and pain is how we grow as people.</p>
        <br>
          <h3>✦ World History</h3><p>My fascination with world history began at a very early age when I'd watch historial documentaries with my father. I think it's so important to understand where we came from as a species; to understand our nature, our triumphs, and our atrocities, so that we can be more informed members of society. Never look away and never forget. We need to know these things to see where we are going, because people are still the same animals we always were.</p>
        <br>
          <h3>✦ Others</h3><p>Mechanical keyboards, goth earrings, pens, tools and gadgets, solarpunk, miniatures and replicas</p>
